Although each notebook can be used independently of the others, the sequence listed below in the \"Fundamentals\" section is intended to offer a gradual introduction to a  logical sequence of topics to introduce you to \"just enough Scala\".  The topics listed under \"A few other useful details\" are more appropriate to dip into whenever you have need or interest.\n",
